## üëäüèª Thanks before you start

This project was created using as a base, 2 distinct projects, being:

+ <https://github.com/raminhuk/react-todo-list>
+ <https://github.com/abdulsamadayoade/redux-todo>

Using the REDUX structure from the **redux-todo** project and the REACT layout and structure from the **react-todo-list** project, I just converted the projects to Typescript with the help of Vite and unified them into one.

## ‚ùì Project purpose

I put this project together just to study, I hope that as the above projects helped me, this project can help you too :)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

In the DevTools console, the project shows an incompatibility message with the React.render feature in React version 18, the problem is caused by the Chakra UI **Toast** and the framework developers are already aware of it.
